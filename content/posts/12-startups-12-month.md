This will be a technical report on the making of 12 startups or platforms in 12 month or less.

## Rules

There are no strict rules, just one core principle: 
Each platform gets up to one month of dedicated attention and focus. 
That doesn't mean we'll abandon it after a month, but the primary focus will shift to the next project. 
The idea is to get something meaningful off the ground quickly, then iterate as needed.

## Projects

- **Social marketing agent**: A multi-agent system with content creatation and planning for different platforms. 
This will be as close to a marketing agent on social platforms as possible.
