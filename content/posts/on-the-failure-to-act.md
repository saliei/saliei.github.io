I was thinking of this as an apology, an apology to act, an apology to self, of being afraid of having almost everything, 
but an apology won't turn the time back. 

Maybe I could have had things easier, but maybe it was me being afraid of having everything. 
I wish I never made it hard, didn't mean for it to be hard.

I thought of every moment, though little they may have been, but not to me, certainly not now.
I wish could have turned the time back, but that's just a wish. 

I wish turn of events could have been different, and many more wishes...
