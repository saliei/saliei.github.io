At CES 2025 event, NVIDIA announced, among other interesting things, including a **single** chip made out of 
72 Blackwell GPUs, with **1.5 ExaFLOPS** performance, it's first world foundation model, [Cosmos](https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/ai/cosmos/). 

DeepMind is working on a similar model, and this is also one of xAI's core missions. I suspect that these 
models are the next frontier in scientific and aritifical intelligence research, after AlphaFold's breakthroughs 
in protein folding prediction, 
and now Microsoft's MatterGen model, which is specifically tailored for matter science.
