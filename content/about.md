# Remain here!

I am Saeid and I'm the author of this mini blog. I'm a physicist by training and passion and 
I do scientific programming on the side, although as I progress in life the priorieties have changed. 
This is mostly what comes to my mind and what I find interesting so that it remains in a corner of the web.
